- 👋 Hi, I’m @slgoldberg (Steven L. Goldberg aka "Steve Goldberg").
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, software engineering, aviation/flight simulation,
X-Plane, front-end and user interface design, distributed systems, and footbag freestyle,
footbag net, and 2-square footbag.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a C++ plugin for X-Plane called
[A-Better-Camera](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/46121-a-better-camera-abc-for-x-plane-11/),
and playing around with a new idea for a plugin for X-Plane called Normalizer.  For my plugins, I'm
cross-compiling for three platforms (as dynamic libraries for 64-bit Linux, Windows, and
macOS) using a combination of Xcode for Mac, and Docker + osxcross + CMake for Windows,
as well as Docker + CMake for Linux.
